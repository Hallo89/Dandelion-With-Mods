Fixed + Refined the bed model for 1.10 and 1.11 totally! Finally! Pls, stop hitting me now q.q
 -> also added a cool display (how it is shown in hand, on the ground,...) for it!
Fixed the not-blocking shield being vanilla in modded due to quark overriding it

Clean up some unused stuff again, saying this ~for awareness~ because you should honor me for doing this!
Fixed the anniversary water particles not being reverted D:
I had no idea that the font was _that_ outdated. But it apparently was no problem, since you never reported it, huh?
 -Updated the font: added a ton of the special versions (`, ´, ^ and so on) of so many letters!
 -Refined the ß and added the captital one, thanks FlubberFrosch!
 -By unicoding!

Refined the coal block having unharmonized colors
Refined the animation of the repeating command block when conditional and normal on the sides!
Fixed the magenta shulker box having litterally one wrong pixel you aren't even capable of seeing. Lol.


|AE2|
Fixed the security terminal GUI being broken
Reworked the old (and let's be honest: pretty ugly) drive model a shit ton by spicing it up to no end!


|Botania|
Removed the binding mode wand texture as it was outdated and not really worth being called a texture
Cleaned up the .mcmeta's. I know nobody is interested in this. I wanted to say it anyway, OK? ;_;
(1.12) Got it to work again


|CTM|
Fixed the bookshelf not being connected


|Ender IO| [mod only 1.10 so far]
Fixed the arrow in the power monitor loving extra, non-fitting pixels too much (;_; I'm sorry, the poor thing!)
Refined the inventory panel a bit!


|Forestry|
Refined various GUIs and cleaned things up
(1.12) Fixed the greenhouse GUIs by adding the new textures
  -- other versions: --
[1.11] Fixed the greenhouse GUIs yet again by adding new textures
 -> note that the 1.11 greenhouse textures aren't really the world's best ones because I haven't really had much time but also will it most likely change in the future and if not,
    not really many people use the greenhouse anyway, yet in 1.11


|IC2|
Added all GUIs yet again
 -> didn't pay attention to new or outdated GUIs for quite long
Refined many GUIs (this took way too long)
 => It is possible that issues arise in the future as IC2 changes its way of doing GUIs like every version and also love to bring in not-working GUIs just to let them rot for ages.
    After this ripening process, the usual IC2 tends to change the GUI additional five times in order to not document what it actually does.
    Meanwhile, they add its icons to the general icon-spreadsheet but decide on using the icon supplied through the actual file anyways


|JEI|
Spiced it up quite a lot:
Added a new "shapeless recipe" icon
Added a better color for the information "i"
(1.11 + 1.12) Refined the look of the small "next recipe" arrow when hovering the mouse over it
(1.12) Got the vanilla parts to work again and refined them a bit
(1.12) Added the "which mod added zis recipe?" indicator, which will possibly get a better icon in the future


|JEI Bees|
Refined it a spicy bit


|Quark|
As mentioned above, fixed the non-blocking shield being overriden by Quark
Added the chest search bar
Added the shulker box content preview display


|Railcraft| [mod only 1.10 so far]
Fixed the abandoned rail not being a model and being outdated in general! It now connects with high grass when you place it beside it, lol!


|Optifine/MCPatcher|
Refined sugarcane to have a better color in different biomes!
