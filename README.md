# Dandelion With Mods (DWM)
A fork of the original Minecraft resource pack [Dandelion](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1243109-16x-1-8-dandelion-biomes-o-plenty-support-updated), adding mod support (mostly GUIs) and lots of vanilla improvements.

## ❗ **DEPRECATION NOTICE** ❗
###  This project is no longer maintained and won't be receiving any more (major) updates.
There are many amazing alternatives to this resource pack, having taken Dandelion farther than I ever could have! Some of DWM's textures and models live on in these. Honorable mentions:
- [Dandelion X](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/dandelion-x) by XeroTrinity
- [Dandelion+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/dandelion-plus) by Hühnerfrikassee
- [Dandelion Draggon](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/dandelion-extended-mods/) by DaxDraggon

Thanks for your continuous support and incredibly nice words over the years, and for making this community into what it is now! ~Hallo89

## Installation
### Download
This resource pack can be downloaded at [Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dandelion-with-mods) and [Planetminecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/mods-addon-pack-for-dandelion-110/), along with a more detailed description of its contents. **Please note that only those two sites are the official hubs for Dandelion With Mods!**

### Git
If you are adept at using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can get the pack directly from the source (this one!) with all experimental and unreleased changes.<br>
To do this, open the location of your `resourcepacks` folder on your terminal and execute the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hallo89/Dandelion-With-Mods/ "Dandelion With Mods"
```
Then you can also easily switch between versions. Replace `<version>` with a valid version branch (`1.10`, `1.11`, `1.12` or `1.13`) or a [release tag](https://github.com/Hallo89/Dandelion-With-Mods/releases):
```sh
git checkout <version>
```

## Contributing
Although most of the work is still done by me, Hallo89, DWM is a community project. Many people have contributed to making this better, whether just by rating textures or texturing some themselves. Contributing is appreciated a lot!

Good ways to contribute are:
- GitHub: Create an issue, fork this repository or make a pull request, etc.
- Disord: The [Dandelion Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/63SnH3V) is a good place to talk about textures
