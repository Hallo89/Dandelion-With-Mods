# Dandelion With Mods
A minecraft resourcepack, being a fork of the original Dandelion but having added tons more stuff

---
## About
This is the official repository for the 'Dandelion With Mods' resource pack, fork (as in 'non-github-fork') of the popular resource pack 'Dandelion' by Steelfeathers for the purpose of mod support and overall continuation of his work (He hasn't retired yet but brings an update maybe once in a few years) by vanilla enhancements regarding textures and models.  

## Installation
This resource pack along with a more detailed description of its contents can be found at [Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dandelion-with-mods) and [Planetminecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/mods-addon-pack-for-dandelion-110/), **and only on those two sites!** *Other sites hosting either this pack or the original Dandelion (which is only found on Planetminecraft) are tricky reposting sites which shouldn't exist*  

You can either install this Resourcepack by downloading the ZIP-file at the above-stated sites or via [Git](https://git-scm.com/), if you have it installed, by opening the location of your `resourcepacks` folder and executing the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hallo89/Dandelion-With-Mods/ "Dandelion With Mods"
```

## Contributing
Although most of the work (besides managing all this) is still done by me, Hallo89, DWM is a community project. Many people have contributed to making this better, whether just by rating textures or texturing some themselves!  

Contributing is appreciated a lot. There are many people having made awesome textures for Dandelion but only posting them at places where they are never to be recognized. Let's combine all those scattered textures in one pack where everyone can enjoy them at once.  

Making a pull request via github is the easiest way for both the contributor and me but you can also write to me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hallo89o), join the [DWM Discord server](https://discord.gg/63SnH3V) or write a comment at the sites where this pack is represented (stated above).

*Of course the contributions will go through a judging hand because I've got some quality standards but I always try to give very constructive and helping critisism*
