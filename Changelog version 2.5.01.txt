|Vanilla Minecraft|
--GUIs--
Added snowy GUIs for winter time!

--Models/Blockstates--
Fixed the json's for randomized stone bricks still being named incorrectly, causing them to have a missing texture most of the time
Fixed the fence gate's display on the ground not being desirable
Rebalanced the weights (how often a specific texture will appear) of randomized end stone to get an overall better result

--Others--
Added a wintry panorama!

Fixed and improved the horse textures!
 -> Fixed horses and donkeys being invisible and wonkey by adapting to their new UV layout
 -> Improved their colors a whole load by unifying and actually adapting them to the dandelion color palette
 -> Improved their textures, including variants, in general by letting many design choices flow into this
Fixed horse armor as well!

Improved the font system a lot!
 -> 1.13 introduced a new file specifically for accented and 'modified' letters with tons of space above and below them:
 -> Added all given accented and modified letters for an awesome font experience
 -> Scaled every font file down to its original size again as there is no need for upscaled accents anymore with the new spacy file, saving memory
 -> Removed unicode page 1E because áºž is now officially supported
